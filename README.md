Hi! I'm a Junior in Biosystems Engineering at UofK. I'm not great at coding, but learning how to get better!

I think that Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop will become valuable tools in my future as an Engineer. It seems like they make coding and compiling information with others, which will likely be a frequent endeavor as a part of things like design teams, easier to do smoothly and keep a valuable Version Control, which stores each version and configuration of our code in case we would like to go back and see or revert changes. 

In this repository, I practiced making and merging changes between GitHub.com, GitHub Desktop, Visual Studio Code, and Arduino IDE, and reflected on how these skills will become useful in BAE305 and future endeavors.
